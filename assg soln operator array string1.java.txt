   C.CONDITIONAL OPERATOR(3)
5.WHAT ARE CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS AND USE OF CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS IN JAVA?
ANS::Conditional statements in Java are the executable block of code (or branch to a specific code) dependent on certain conditions.
 A.If statement
B.If else statement
C.Switch Statement


6.WHAT IS THE SYNTAX OF IF-ELSE STATEMENT?
ANS::if (conhition) {

 	 // blocK of code to be executed if conhition is true.

10.STATE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRINGBUILDER AND STRINBUFFER IN JAVA?
ANS:; STRINGBUFFER::StringBuffer is synchronized . It means two threads can't call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously
         =>StringBuffer is less efficient than StringBuilder.
       STRINGBUILDER::StringBuilder is non-synchronized . It means two threads can call the methods of StringBuilder simultaneously.
                     =>StringBuilder is more efficient than StringBuffer.
